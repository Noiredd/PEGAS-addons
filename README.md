# PEGAS addons library
Here you can find user-made addons for PEGAS, or share your own!

Addons are a great tool to "hack" PEGAS to make it do something you want without the need to modify its own code
(or wait for me to implement a feature that you happen to need).

### Installing addons
1. Download the addon file from this repository (navigate to the desired file and click "Raw").
2. Put this file in the `addons/` directory within `Script` (where your PEGAS is installed).
3. Done! PEGAS will detect addons automatically.

### List of addons
Code of each invididual addon is property of its author.
Every addon is shared on its invididual license.

Name | Description | Author | Help | License
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---

### Creating addons
Head over to the main PEGAS repository for [documentation](https://github.com/Noiredd/PEGAS/docs/addons.md) on the addons system.

### Contributing
So you want to share your addon? Great!
All contributions are welcome and will be accepted immediately (i.e. without testing!),
provided these simple [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) are followed.

### Issues
Having a problem with one of the addons?
Open an issue and tell us what's wrong.
Please give the name of the suspected addon in issue title, like so:  
"[addon_name] short description of the problem"

Then describe your problem in detail in issue text.
Feel free to attach all relevant script files, like `vehicle`, `sequence` descriptions etc.

Please DO NOT open issues related to PEGAS the main program -
even related to the addons subsystem.
If you feel there's a problem with it or have an extension in mind,
open an issue in the [main repository](https://github.com/Noiredd/PEGAS).
