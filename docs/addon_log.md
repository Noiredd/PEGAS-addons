## Addon Log
This addon simply dumps info on all currently registered addons into a file.
Currently I don't have any good idea on notifying the user on which addons have been correctly registered,
so here we are.

You can also think of it as a demo for the addons subsystem and a reference for future submissions.

### Config
You can change the path to the output file by changing the following line:
```
LOCAL logPath IS "addons.log".
```
